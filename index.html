<h2>An Analysis of "Jury Learning: Integrating Dissenting Voices into Machine
  Learning Models"</h2>
</div>

<div class="col">

<h2>Introduction/Motivation</h2>

<p>Jury Learning introduces a novel approach in supervised machine learning (ML) to address the challenge of label disagreements in societal contexts, such as online toxicity, misinformation detection, and medical diagnosis. Traditional ML methods typically use majority voting to resolve these disagreements, often overshadowing minority perspectives. The innovative solution proposed is 'jury learning,' which explicitly considers diverse societal opinions. This method involves forming a 'jury' of diverse annotators to determine the classifier's predictions, thereby integrating varied viewpoints and responses to societal disagreements. The paper presents a deep learning architecture that models individual annotators, allowing for dynamic jury compositions and enhanced representation of minority views. This approach not only accommodates diverse opinions but also significantly alters classification outcomes,
  indicating its potential for creating more inclusive and representative ML models.

<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<p>
  <b>Engaging Stakeholders in Algorithm Design: </b> The paper discusses the critique of unexamined majoritarianism in governance, which tends to exclude minority viewpoints. In response to this, jury learning is introduced as a means to control how majorities are formed, raising awareness of the consequences of potential majorities and encouraging intentionality in their selection. This approach aligns with the need in human-computer interaction and AI fairness for algorithms that balance multiple stakeholders' needs and interests. The work builds on advancements in algorithmic fairness, focusing on managing disparate beliefs and emphasizing the inclusion of diverse voices in algorithmic decision-making[1].
</p>
<p>
  <b>Disagreement Datasets and Machine Learning: </b> The paper explores the common practice in machine learning of using large datasets of individual beliefs, often aggregated into a single 'ground truth' label through majority voting. This method, while successful in many AI tasks, has limitations, especially in contexts where societal and cultural disagreements exist. The authors highlight the importance of understanding not just the existence of disagreement but also the nature and reasons behind it. They propose annotator-level modeling to better capture the distribution of opinions and provide insights into who disagrees and why. This approach contrasts with traditional methods that strive for an impartial and supposedly "unbiased" dataset, which may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of societal opinions[2].
</p>
<p>
  <b>Real-Time Exploration and Tuning of Classifier Populations: </b> The paper addresses the practical challenges in machine learning related to the static nature of datasets. Traditional methods often require large-scale data collection whenever the relevant stakeholders change. The jury learning approach, however, allows practitioners to model each relevant individual or group from existing datasets, enabling them to reason over and specify which individuals or groups their models should reflect. This method offers a more dynamic and responsive way of incorporating diverse voices into machine learning models without the need for continually collecting new datasets[3].

<h2>Methodology</h2>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="images/model.png" alt="Model Architecture" width="800" height="300">
    </div>
    <p>
      A Deep & Cross Network (DCN) is used in the architecture. A typical DCN involves three sets of embeddings: content, annotator, and group. The content embedding enables prediction on previously unseen items by mapping those items into a shared space. The group embeddings make use of the data from all annotators who belong to each group, helping overcome sparsity in the dataset. The annotator embedding ensures that the model learns when each annotator differs from the groups they belong to. The DCN learns to combine these embeddings to predict each individual annotator's reaction to an example: the embeddings are concatenated into an input layer, then fed into a cross network containing multiple cross layers that model explicit feature interactions, and then combined with a deep network that models implicit feature interactions. The DCN architecture is modified to jointly train a pre-trained BERT-based model, using its pooler output as the content embeddings.

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="images/model_performance.PNG" alt=": Performance against individual annotator's test labels" width="800" height="300">
    </div>
    <p> Performance against individual annotator's test labels for three models: today's standard state-of-the-art aggregate
      approach (which is annotator-agnostic, and makes one prediction per example), a group-specific version of our proposed architecture, and the full version of our proposed architecture. The standard aggregated model’s performance varies substantially
      between groups. For instance, it achieves an MAE of 0.83 for Asian annotators and 1.12 for Black annotators, a performance decrease of 35.0%. By comparison, we find that our model does show differences between groups, but with far smaller magnitudes.
      It achieves an MAE of 0.62 for Asian annotators and 0.65 for Black annotators, a performance decrease of 4.9%. </p>

    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="images/user-evaluation.png" alt="User Evaluation" width="800" height="300">
    </div>
    <p> For user evaluation, authors selected 19 content moderators. They explained them the Jury Learning algorithm, showed them a sample of toxic comments, and asked them to comprise juries. They found that in average 13.6% of decisions flipped between jury learning classifier customized for a community and an off the shelf classifier.</p>
    

    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <img src="images/main_diag.PNG" alt="System Overview" width="800" height="500">
   </div>
   <p> In the Jury Selection portion of the system, the user can create juror sheets to populate their jury
    composition and can provide one or more input examples to evaluate. Then, the system outputs the Jury Learning Results
    section where they can view a summary of the jury verdict based on a median-of-means estimator of jury outcomes. Here, they
    can view the full distribution of jury outcomes, select individual juries to view trends, and inspect individual jurors on a jury.
    When a user selects a jury, the Jury Trends section is updated. There, they can group by different fields like the juror sheet,
    decision label, or other demographic attributes to understand patterns in the labels from this jury and contextualize them
    with respect to the larger population. When a user selects a particular juror, the Juror Details view opens, and they can
    inspect the predicted label for the juror, the background of this juror, and the juror's annotations. Users can also inspect
    counterfactual juries that would result in the opposite verdict </p>


<h2>Social Impact</h2>
    <br>

    <h3>Positive Impacts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Provides an orthogonal view of fairness. Fairness in AI has been output-centered but this paper provides an opportunity to include fairness at the model input level.</li>

        <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> Provides a way to include the values of diverse groups of people.</li>

        <li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> Ensures we can hear the voices of underrepresented groups and learn from them.</li>

        <li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> Provides visualizations and model results that are more interpretable.</li>

        <li><strong>Better Decision Making:</strong> ML and HCI Practitioners can visualize results which can lead to better decision making.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Negative Impacts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bias:</strong> Biased Jurors and ML practitioners can create harmful models.</li>

        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> As it involves a lot of information about the demographics and identity of annotators, it can affect their privacy.</li>

        <li><strong>Abdication of Responsibility:</strong> Who should be held accountable if something goes wrong? ML practitioners, jurors, or companies deploying the model.</li>

        <li><strong>Ecological Fallacy:</strong> We associate attributes on a group with individuals when we take the means of all the juries as the final output.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Industrial Application</h2>
    <p> Companies can shift the AI models they use to this new paradigm based on Jury Learning. It offers better interpretability, visualization and decision making. Suppose you are a journalist and your comment was removed by a toxicity detection model, you would want to know what about it was toxic. With Jury Learning, the companies can provide a better reasoning like "A jury of 6 people including 2 black women, 2 white women, and 2 asian men found this toxic". </p>
    <p> Companies also don't have to undergo the tedious and time-consuming process of creating ML models for different target population. They can use same model but a jury composition that represents the target population the best. </p>

    <h2>Academic Research</h2>
    <p> Jury learning currently models values and voices of annotators based on their demographics. An intriguing avenue for expanding this research would be implicitly deriving these values and voices from the data, without necessitating explicit demographic information. This would allow models to learn more nuanced values of a person which are not just based on their identity or demographics.  Consider a dietitian striving to suggest the optimal food items for a person. Employing a "jury learning" model with implicit values learning that learns from  past data of  the target individual and comparable profiles would help in making food items suggestion based on preferences and values of the individual. This nuanced approach would help us build human-centric ML models that are grounded in values and preferences.</p>
